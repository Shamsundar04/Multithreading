	Hard-Level Oral Interview Questions on join() Method
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	1️ Can a thread call join() on itself? What happens?
	Answer:
	Yes, a thread can technically call join() on itself, but it causes a deadlock.
	The thread waits for itself to finish, which is impossible, so the program never terminates.
	
	2️ Difference between join() and sleep() in terms of locks held?
	Answer:
	- sleep() → pauses the current thread but keeps all locks it holds.
	- join() → pauses the calling thread until another thread finishes and releases any locks on synchronized objects if waiting.
	
	3️ If multiple threads call join() on the same thread, what happens?
	Answer:
	All calling threads will wait for the target thread to finish. Once the target thread completes, all waiting threads are released simultaneously.
	
	4️ How does join() internally work in Java?
	Answer:
	Internally, join() calls wait() on the target thread object until isAlive() becomes false.
	- If timeout is specified, it waits at most that time.
	- Throws InterruptedException if the waiting thread is interrupted.
	
	5️ Can join() guarantee absolute order of execution in multi-threading?
	Answer:
	Not absolutely in general. It guarantees only that the calling thread waits until the target thread finishes.
	Other threads not involved in join() may still run concurrently.
	
	6️ What happens if you call join() on a thread that hasn’t started yet?
	Answer:
	If a thread is not started, calling join() returns immediately because there’s nothing to wait for.
	
	7️ Can join() be used as a synchronization mechanism instead of synchronized blocks?
	Answer:
	Yes, partially. join() ensures sequential execution for dependent threads.
	However, it does not protect shared data, so it cannot replace proper synchronized blocks for data consistency.
	
	8️ Explain a scenario where join(long millis) is useful?
	Answer:
	join(long millis) is useful when you want the calling thread to wait for another thread only for a limited time.
	For example, waiting for a background worker to finish but continuing execution if it takes too long.
	
	9️ What will happen if join() is called on a thread that already completed?
	Answer:
	The calling thread does not wait and continues immediately because the target thread is no longer alive.
	
	10 Can join() throw an exception? If yes, when?
	Answer:
	Yes, join() can throw InterruptedException if the waiting thread is interrupted while waiting for the target thread to finish.
