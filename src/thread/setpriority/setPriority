	Thread Priority in Java:

	It is possible in java to assign priority to a Thread. 
	Thread class has provided two predefined methods setPriority(int newPriority) 
	and getPriority() to set and get the priority of the thread respectively.
	
	public final void setPriority(int newPriority)
	{
	}
	
	public final int getPriority()
	{
		 this.priority;
	}
	
	In java we can set the priority of the Thread in numbers from 1-10 only where 1 is the minimum priority and 10 is the maximum priority.
	Whenever we create a thread in java by default its priority would be 5 that is normal priority.
	The user-defined thread created as a part of main thread will acquire the same priority of main Thread.
	Thread class has also provided 3 final static variables which are as follows :-
	
	public static final int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;
	public static final int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;
	public static final int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
	
	Note: We can't set the priority of the Thread beyond the limit(1-10) so if we set the priority beyond 
	the limit (1 to 10) then it will generate an exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.
