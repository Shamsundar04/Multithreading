	E-Commerce Order Processing
	
	Create 4 threads:
	
	InventoryCheck
	
	PaymentProcessing
	
	Packaging
	
	Dispatch
	
	🧠 Logic:
	
	InventoryCheck and PaymentProcessing run simultaneously
	
	Once both are done → start Packaging
	
	Then → Dispatch
	
	💡 Use join() to synchronize dependencies.
	
	
	
	
	🧩 What Makes This Example Special

	This example introduces dependency management between threads, which is super common in real-world projects.
	
	1.Parallel execution:
	
		InventoryCheck and PaymentProcessing can run at the same time, because they are independent.
		This teaches concurrent execution, which is faster than doing one after the other.
	
	2.Sequential dependencies:
	
		Packaging can only start after both Inventory and Payment are done.
		Dispatch can only start after Packaging is done.
		This teaches thread synchronization using .join().
	
	3.Real-world analogy:
		
		In online shopping, multiple tasks happen simultaneously, but some tasks must wait for others.
		Understanding this helps you design efficient systems where you don’t block all threads unnecessarily.
