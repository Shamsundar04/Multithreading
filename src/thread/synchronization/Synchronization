	*** Synchronization :
	*
	It is a technique through which we can control multiple threads but accepting only one thread at a time.
	*
	In order to achieve synchronization, we should use synchronized keyword.
	* Synchronized are is a restricted area so with permission only a thread can enter inside synchronized area.
	* Synchronization is divided into two types :
	1) Method Level Synchronization
	2) Block Level Synchronization
	1) Method Level Synchronization :
	t1
	t2 t3
	t4
	t5
	tn
	All the threads will wait at method level & only one thread will enter inside the synchronized area.
