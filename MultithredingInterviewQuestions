	Thread class Constructor:
	
	* Thread class provided total 10 contsructors. 
	The following are the commonly used constructor of Thread class.
	1) Thread t1 = new Thread();
	2) Thread t2 = new Thread(String name);
	3) Thread t3 = new Thread(Runnable target); //loose Coupling
	4) Thread t4 = new Thread(Runnable target, String name);
	5) Thread t5 = new Thread(ThreadGroup tg, Runnable target);
	6) Thread t6 = new Thread(ThreadGroup tg, String name);
	7) Thread t7 = new Thread(ThreadGroup tg, Runnable target, String name);
	
	## Synchronization :- 
	Synchronization allowing only one thread at a time to access a shared resource 
	(like a variable, method, or object).
	
	## Race Condition :-
	A race condition happens when two or more threads try to access or modify the same data at the same time,
	and the final result depends on the order in which the threads run.
	
	## Technical Definition :- 
	In Java, synchronization is a thread-safety mechanism that prevents race conditions by 
	using an intrinsic lock (monitor) associated with every object.

	When one thread acquires the lock on an object,
	No other thread can enter a synchronized method or block on that same object until the lock is released.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
		What is the purpose of the sleep() method in Java?
	Simple Explanation:
	
	The sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the current thread for 
	a specific time (in milliseconds or nanoseconds).
	
	When a thread calls sleep(), it moves from the RUNNING state to the TIMED_WAITING state.
	
	After the specified time, the thread becomes RUNNABLE again and waits for CPU scheduling.
